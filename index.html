            <p>[UPDATE 18 DECEMBER 2017] RONALDO HELPS BUILD A CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN CHILE
                On 18 December 2017 it was announced that Cristiano Ronaldo is to fund the construction of a children's hospital in Santiago, Chile, according to his lawyers.  In a statement from New York-based law firm Brafman & Associates, it's noted the pediatrics facility will be finished before the year 2020. Italian businessman Alessandro Proto will also support the construction, according to bleacherreport.com
                Our previous update on Ronaldo's positive initiatives, was from June 2016. Ronaldo was born and raised on the Portuguese island Madeira. In spring 2016, the island was hit by severe wildfires that have claimed the lives of 3 people, injured many and destroyed many homes. Two days after the start of the wildfires, Ronaldo has offered the island an undisclosed amount of financial aid to help people recover from this disaster. <br>

              <h2>Manchester United</h2>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo’s first United game as a substitute in the season opener against Bolton [Wanderers]   was undoubtedly the most exciting debut performance I’ve ever seen.A few of my old team-mates were at the game and they compared him to me. There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it’s been a compliment to me. There have been players who have some similarities, but this lad’s got more than anyone else, especially as he is genuinely two-footed. He can play on either wing, beat players with ease and put in dangerous crosses with his left or right peg. When was the last time you saw that?  
                With Ronaldo and Giggsy on the pitch at the same time, opposition defenders will be petrified!

                He scored 451 goals for Los Blancos in just 438 matches. This makes CR7 the top scorer in the history of Real Madrid.
